# Magisk App Freezer

Automatically freeze magisk app if any app in DenyList is opened (except Google Play Store). Magisk app will get restored after you close all apps in DenyList.

From Android 11+, App cannot detect `/data/data/com.topjohnwu.magisk` directory so no need to use random package for Magisk before freezing Magisk

Do not add apps like Chrome and keyboard app into DenyList.
